@article{wildes_advancing_2014,
  abstract      = {This article discusses the need for advancing research on cognitive flexibility in eating disorders and the importance of distinguishing attentional set‐shifting and reversal learning. Cognitive inflexibility has received considerable attention as a putative mechanism that might increase the risk for eating disorder (ED) onset, and influence illness course and treatment response. However, research findings have been mixed and have not led to advances in treatment outcome. Using a framework informed by cognitive neuroscience, the authors contend that separating two discrete facets of cognitive flexibility that are conflated in measures currently employed in the EDs field will help elucidate the mechanisms that underlie its relation with ED symptoms. A critical step in studying cognitive flexibility is to clarify the behavioral and neural dimensions that are most salient to EDs. Importantly, attentional set-shifting and reversal learning have distinct neural correlates. The selection of behavioral tasks is critical for explicating the roles of attentional set-shifting and reversal learning in EDs. Future work is needed to clarify whether attentional set-shifting is salient to EDs, or whether other forms of cognitive inflexibility, such as impaired reversal learning, are responsible for clinical neuropsychological findings.

@article{miles2020cognitive,
  abstract   = {Difficulties in cognitive flexibility--the ability to adapt effectively to changes in the environment and/or changing task demands--have been reported in anorexia nervosa (AN). However, findings are inconsistent across studies and it remains unclear which specific aspects of cognitive flexibility patients with AN may struggle with. This systematic review aimed to synthesise existing research on cognitive flexibility in AN and clarify differences between patients with acute AN, patients who are weight-restored and patients who are fully recovered from AN. Electronic databases were searched through to January 2020. 3,310 papers were screened and 70 papers were included in the final review. Although adults with acute AN performed worse in perceptual flexibility tasks and self-report measures compared to HCs, they did not exhibit deficits across all domains of cognitive flexibility. Adolescents with acute AN did not differ to HCs in performance on neurocognitive tasks despite self-reporting poorer cognitive flexibility. Overall, significant differences in cognitive flexibility between acute and recovered participants was not evident, though, the findings are limited by a modest number of studies. Recovered participants performed poorer than HCs in some neurocognitive measures, however, results were inconsistent across studies. These results have implications for the assessment of cognitive flexibility in AN and targeted treatment approaches.},

In Axelrod's simulations, the simple strategy tit-for-tat did outstandingly well and subsequently became the major paradigm for reciprocal altruism4 12. Here we present extended evolutionary simulations of heterogeneous ensembles of probabilistic strategies including mutation and selection, and report the unexpected success of another protagonist: Pavlov. This strategy is as simple as tit-for-tat and embodies the fundamental behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift, which seems to be a widespread rule13. Pavlov's success is based on two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

  abstract   = {The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has become the paradigm for the evolution of cooperation among egoists. Since Axelrod's classic computer tournaments and Nowak and Sigmund's extensive simulations of evolution, we know that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma. According to recent developments of theory the last champion strategy of "win--stay, lose--shift" ("Pavlov") is the winner only if the players act simultaneously. In the more natural situation of players alternating the roles of donor and recipient a strategy of "Generous Tit-for-Tat" wins computer simulations of short-term memory strategies. We show here by experiments with humans that cooperation dominated in both the simultaneous and the alternating Prisoner's Dilemma. Subjects were consistent in their strategies: 30\% adopted a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy, whereas 70\% used a Pavlovian strategy in both the alternating and the simultaneous game. As predicted for unconditional strategies, Pavlovian players appeared to be more successful in the simultaneous game whereas Generous Tit-for-Tat-like players achieved higher payoffs in the alternating game. However, the Pavlovian players were smarter than predicted: they suffered less from defectors and exploited cooperators more readily. Humans appear to cooperate either with a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy or with a strategy that appreciates Pavlov's advantages but minimizes its handicaps.},

Here we use Japanese and German football data to investigate correlates between temporal patterns of formation changes across matches and match results. We found that individual teams and managers both showed win-stay lose-shift behavior, a type of reinforcement learning. In other words, they tended to stick to the current formation after a win and switch to a different formation after a loss. In addition, formation changes did not statistically improve the results of succeeding matches. The results indicate that a swift implementation of a new formation in the win-stay lose-shift manner may not be a successful managerial rule of thumb.},

  abstract      = {Summary
                   Serotonin and dopamine are speculated to subserve motivationally opponent functions, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We studied the role of these neurotransmitters in probabilistic reversal learning in nearly 700 individuals as a function of two polymorphisms in the genes encoding the serotonin and dopamine transporters (SERT: 5HTTLPR plus rs25531; DAT1 3′UTR VNTR). A double dissociation was observed. The SERT polymorphism altered behavioral adaptation after losses, with increased lose-shift associated with L′ homozygosity, while leaving unaffected perseveration after reversal. In contrast, the DAT1 genotype affected the influence of prior choices on perseveration, while leaving lose-shifting unaltered. A model of reinforcement learning captured the dose-dependent effect of DAT1 genotype, such that an increasing number of 9R-alleles resulted in a stronger reliance on previous experience and therefore reluctance to update learned associations. These data provide direct evidence for doubly dissociable effects of serotonin and dopamine systems.},

@article{camerer_experience-weighted_1999,
  abstract      = {In `experience-weighted attraction' (EWA) learning, strategies have attractions that reflect initial predispositions, are updated based on payoff experience, and determine choice probabilities according to some rule (e.g., logit). A key feature is a parameter δ that weights the strength of hypothetical reinforcement of strategies that were not chosen according to the payoff they would have yielded, relative to reinforcement of chosen strategies according to received payoffs. The other key features are two discount rates, φ and ρ, which separately discount previous attractions, and an experience weight. EWA includes reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play (belief learning) as special cases, and hybridizes their key elements. When δ= 0 and ρ= 0, cumulative choice reinforcement results. When δ= 1 and ρ=φ, levels of reinforcement of strategies are exactly the same as expected payoffs given weighted fictitious play beliefs. Using three sets of experimental data, parameter estimates of the model were calibrated on part of the data and used to predict a holdout sample. Estimates of δ are generally around .50, φ around .8 − 1, and ρ varies from 0 to φ. Reinforcement and belief-learning special cases are generally rejected in favor of EWA, though belief models do better in some constant-sum games. EWA is able to combine the best features of previous approaches, allowing attractions to begin and grow flexibly as choice reinforcement does, but reinforcing unchosen strategies substantially as belief-based models implicitly do.},

@article{gelman_inference_1992,
  abstract      = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). NHST has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

  abstract   = {The Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) is a self-report instrument that assesses the severity of the four most empirically supported OC symptom dimensions (Contamination, Responsibility, Unacceptable Thoughts, and Symmetry). The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the DOCS and address associations with socio-demographical variables, psychometric properties in a community (i.e., non-student) sample, and congruence of factor solutions across non-clinical and patient samples. Factor structure, internal consistency, construct, and criterion validity were investigated in three samples of participants (315 from the general population, 106 OCD patients and 31 with other anxiety disorders [OADs]). Results supported the four-factor structure of the DOCS both in clinical and non-clinical sample, and adequate levels of factor congruence across the two samples were found. DOCS scores showed good internal consistency, temporal stability and construct validity, and could adequately discriminate between non-clinical participants, OCD and OADs patients. All the other variables kept constant, associations of DOCS total score with educational level, of Contamination with gender, and of Unacceptable Thoughts with age were also found. These findings suggest that the Italian version of the DOCS retains the adequate psychometric properties of the original, and can be confidently used as an assessment tool of OC symptoms in clinical and research settings.},

@article{gruner_cognitive_2017,
  abstract   = {Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by maladaptive patterns of repetitive, inflexible cognition and behavior that suggest a lack of cognitive flexibility. Consistent with this clinical observation, many neurocognitive studies suggest behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities in cognitive flexibility in individuals with OCD. Meta-analytic reviews support a pattern of cognitive inflexibility, with effect sizes generally in the medium range. Heterogeneity in assessments and the way underlying constructs have been operationalized point to the need for better standardization across studies, as well as more refined overarching models of cognitive flexibility and executive function (EF). Neuropsychological assessments of cognitive flexibility include measures of attentional set shifting, reversal and alternation, cued task-switching paradigms, cognitive control measures such as the Trail-Making and Stroop tasks, and several measures of motor inhibition. Differences in the cognitive constructs and neural substrates associated with these measures suggest that performance within these different domains should be examined separately. Additional factors, such as the number of consistent trials prior to a shift and whether a shift is explicitly signaled or must be inferred from a change in reward contingencies, may influence performance, and thus mask or accentuate deficits. Several studies have described abnormalities in neural activation in the absence of differences in behavioral performance, suggesting that our behavioral probes may not be adequately sensitive, but also offering important insights into potential compensatory processes. The fact that deficits of moderate effect size are seen across a broad range of classic neuropsychological tests in OCD presents a conceptual challenge, as clinical symptomatology suggests greater specificity. Traditional cognitive probes may not be sufficient to delineate specific domains of deficit in this and other neuropsychiatric disorders; a new generation of behavioral tasks that test more specific underlying constructs, supplemented by neuroimaging to provide insight into the underlying processes, may be needed.},

Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted.

We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

  abstract      = {Inference using significance testing and Bayes factors is compared and contrasted in five case studies based on real research. The first study illustrates that the methods will often agree, both in motivating researchers to conclude that H1 is supported better than H0, and the other way round, that H0 is better supported than H1. The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intuitions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-significant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, conversely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a high-powered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be evidentially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.},

His ideas were way ahead of their time and it is only in the past ten years that the subject of Bayes' factors has been significantly developed and extended. Until recently the two schools of statistics (Bayesian and Frequentist) were distinctly different and set apart. Recent work (aided by increased computer power and availability) has changed all that and today's graduate students and researchers all require an understanding of Bayesian ideas. This book is their starting point.},

  abstract      = {Our decisions are guided by outcomes that are associated with decisions made in the past. However, the amount of influence each past outcome has on our next decision remains unclear. To ensure optimal decision-making, the weight given to decision outcomes should reflect their salience in predicting future outcomes, and this salience should be modulated by the volatility of the reward environment. We show that human subjects assess volatility in an optimal manner and adjust decision-making accordingly. This optimal estimate of volatility is reflected in the fMRI signal in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when each trial outcome is observed. When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes. Furthermore, variations in this ACC signal across the population predict variations in subject learning rates. Our results provide a formal account of how we weigh our different experiences in guiding our future actions.},

Participants were assessed by trained clinicians using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule 4th edition, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and an unstructured clinical interview. Subjects completed the MOS-36 Item Short Form Health Survey, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Obsessive-compulsive symptom severity was negatively correlated with emotional health, social functioning and general health QoL. Depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and emotional health, social functioning and general health QoL. Additionally, interference of obsessive-compulsive symptoms mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and emotional health, social functioning and general health QoL. Resistance against obsessive-compulsive symptoms mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and social functioning QoL. Diminished QoL is present in persons with OCD and is essential in understanding the complete clinical picture of OCD.},

  abstract   = {Objective: To provide a description of the methods and key findings of the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing.Method: A national face-to-face household survey of 8841 (60\% response rate) community residents aged between 16 and 85 years was carried out using the World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Diagnoses were made according to ICD-10. Key findings include the prevalence of mental disorder, sex and age distributions of mental disorders, severity of mental disorders, comorbidity among mental disorders, and the extent of disability and health service use associated with mental disorders.Results: The prevalence of any lifetime mental disorder was 45.5\%. The prevalence of any 12 month mental disorder was 20.0\%, with anxiety disorders (14.4\%) the most common class of mental disorder followed by affective disorders (6.2\%) and substance use disorders (5.1\%). Mental disorders, particularly affective disorders, were disabling. One in four people (25.4\%) with 12 month mental disorders had more than one class of mental disorder. One-third (34.9\%) of people with a mental disorder used health services for mental health problems in the 12 months prior to the interview.Conclusions: Mental disorders are common in Australia. Many people have more than one class of mental disorder. Mental disorders are associated with substantial disability, yet many people with mental disorders do not seek help for their mental health problems.},

  abstract   = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a serious and often chronically disabling condition. The current dominant model of OCD focuses on abnormalities in prefrontal-striatal circuits that support executive function (EF). Although there is growing evidence for EF impairments associated with OCD, results have been inconsistent, which makes the nature and magnitude of these impairments controversial. The current meta-analysis uses random-effects models to synthesize 110 studies in which participants with OCD were compared with healthy control participants on at least one neuropsychological measure of EF. The results indicate that individuals with OCD are impaired on tasks measuring most aspects of EF, consistent with broad impairment in EF. EF deficits were not explained by general motor slowness or depression. Effect sizes were largely stable across variation in demographic and clinical characteristics of samples, although medication use, age, and gender moderated some effects.},

@article{gillan_claire_m._goal-directed_2014,
  abstract   = {Obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD) has become a paradigmatic case of goal-directed dysfunction in psychiatry. In this article, we review the neurobiological evidence, historical and recent, that originally led to this supposition and continues to support a habit hypothesis of OCD. We will then discuss a number of recent studies that have directly tested this hypothesis, using behavioural experiments in patient populations. Based on this research evidence, which suggests that rather than goal-directed avoidance behaviours, compulsions in OCD may derive from manifestations of excessive habit formation, we present the details of a novel account of the functional relationship between these habits and the full symptom profile of the disorder. Borrowing from a cognitive dissonance framework, we propose that the irrational threat beliefs (obsessions) characteristic of OCD may be a consequence, rather than an instigator, of compulsive behaviour in these patients. This lays the foundation for a potential shift in both clinical and neuropsychological conceptualization of OCD and related disorders. This model may also prove relevant to other putative disorders of compulsivity, such as substance dependence, where the experience of `wanting' drugs may be better understood as post hoc rationalizations of otherwise goal-insensitive, stimulus-driven behaviour.},

@article{fradkin_rigidly_2018,
  abstract   = {Several recent models of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) consider it to be a neurocognitive disorder involving inflexibility and disinhibition. Indeed, previous reviews of neuropsychological functioning in OCD suggested impaired performance in flexibility tasks. The current meta-analysis examines whether the reported differences in flexibility can be explained by general underperformance unrelated to flexibility. In addition, the role of feedback processing in inflexibility is investigated. To this end, we integrated evidence from 75 studies that compared patients with OCD with nonpsychiatric controls on at least one flexibility measure, while applying a novel approach in which task scores measuring flexibility were compared with control scores from the same tasks measuring other confounding processes. The results revealed no evidence for inflexibility in OCD, with patients' performance most parsimoniously explained by nonspecific factors. These results challenge models stressing inflexibility as an endophenotype of OCD. Methodological implications for reviewing cognitive deficits in psychopathology are discussed.},

In this paper, we present two studies that systematically examine NJREs in large undergraduate samples.

Further, NJREs were shown to have particularly strong relationships with specific OCD symptom clusters (e.g., checking, ordering). Finally, NJREs were significantly more strongly correlated with features of OCD than symptoms from other domains of psychopathology (e.g., social anxiety, trait anxiety, worry, depression).

Research using self-report questionnaires has demonstrated a link between not just right experiences (NJREs) and OCD symptoms (Behav. Res. Therapy 41 (2003) 681; Anxiety, 1 (1995) 208). Extending previous work, this paper presents experimental and self-monitoring data on NJREs in an undergraduate sample. NJREs produced distress and urges to change something, but feared consequences were rare. Stronger responses were found for naturally occurring self-monitored NJREs compared to NJREs elicited in the laboratory. Several significant relationships were found between features of NJREs and OC symptoms and constructs theoretically related to OCD (e.g., responsibility, incompleteness), but no significant relationships were found between features of NJREs and non-OCD-related constructs (worry, depressive symptoms, social anxiety). Further consideration of NJREs will be useful in improving our understanding of the phenomenology, neurobiological substrates, and treatment, of OCD.},

NJREs are currently considered specific to obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but results from prior studies might have been affected by the assessment of NJREs that were particularly relevant to only obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Method A large community sample of adults recruited through the Internet (N = 480, Mean age = 32.9 years, 54.7\% female) completed self-report measures of symptom types and a modified self-report measure of NJREs. Results Consistent with predictions, NJREs tended to share statistically equivalent zero-order correlations with all of the assessed symptom types. NJREs were significantly related to only generalized anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for important covariates, including general distress, perfection/certainty, and the overlap among the symptom types. Conclusions These results suggest that NJREs are relevant to a broader range of symptom types than previously thought.},

  abstract   = {The cognitive model of OCD proposes that certain beliefs may contribute to the development and maintenance of this disorder. To date, however, it is not yet clear which beliefs are more relevant for explaining OCD symptomatology; moreover, their causal status is yet to be clearly established. In the effort to identify other constructs and processes related to OCD, the phenomenon labeled ``not just right experiences'' (NJREs) has received increasing attention. In this study, measures of NJREs (the NJRE-Q-R), OCD symptoms, general distress (i.e., anxiety, and depression), and perfectionism were administered to a large sample of college students and a small sample of OCD and non-OCD patients. The clinical sample also completed a measure of OC beliefs. Results showed that NJREs could be reliably measured through a self-report format in non-clinical and clinical Italian individuals. A specific association between NJREs severity and OCD symptoms was found in the non-clinical sample, after controlling for anxiety, depression, and perfectionism. The NJRE-Q-R Severity scale clearly discriminated OCD patients from patients with other anxiety disorders or depression. Lastly, the NJREs measure differentiated the clinical groups when OC beliefs were controlled, whereas OC beliefs did not discriminate among the groups after NJREs severity was controlled. The concept of NJREs may contribute to improve current psychological and biological model of OCD.},

@article{maltby_dysfunctional_2005,
  abstract   = {Converging evidence suggests that hyperactivity in frontal--striatal circuits and in action-monitoring processes characterizes obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD). It remains unclear, however, just how these abnormalities in brain function translate into the cognitive, affective, and behavioral manifestations of OCD. One possibility is that exaggerated or false error signals generated by the anterior cingulate (ACC) underlie compulsive behaviors by triggering the feeling that things are ``not just right'' even when no actual error has been made. Since recurrent compulsive behavior typically follows correct completion of a behavioral task (e.g., hand washing), ACC hyperactivity should be observed during correctly completed, high-conflict trials as well as during error trials. Frontal--striatal regions would also be expected to be activated during both trial types, as these regions are robustly associated with OCD across multiple neuroimaging paradigms. To test this hypothesis, 14 OCD patients and 14 matched controls completed a speeded reaction time task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Only correctly rejected, high-conflict trials produced excessive activation in both action monitoring (rostral and caudal ACC, LPFC) and frontal striatal regions (lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate, and thalamus) among OCD patients when compared to healthy controls. Portions of the posterior cingulate were also hyperactive among OCD patients. These results suggest that correctly rejected, high-conflict trials that require response inhibition may provide a better model than error trials of compulsive behaviors in OCD.},

@article{veen_timing_2002,
  abstract   = {The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to respond to conflict between simultaneously active, incompatible response tendencies. This area is active during high-conflict correct trials and also when participants make errors. Here, we use the temporal resolution of high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) in combination with source localization to investigate the timing of ACC activity during conflict and error detection. We predicted that the same area of the ACC is active prior to high-conflict correct responses and following erroneous responses. Dipole modeling supported this prediction: The frontocentral N2, occurring prior to the response on correct conflict trials, and the ERN, occurring immediately following error responses, could both be modeled as having a generator in the caudal ACC, suggesting the same process to underlie both peaks. Modeling further suggested that the rostral area of the ACC was also active following errors, but later in time, contributing to the error positivity (PE), and peaking at 200--250 msec following the ERN peak. Despite the inherent limitations of source localization, these data may begin to shed light on the timing of action-monitoring processes. First, the time course of caudal ACC activity follows the time course as predicted by the conflict theory of this region. Second, caudal ACC activity might be temporally dissociated from rostral ACC activity during error trials, which possibly reflects a separate, affective component of the evaluative functions of the ACC.},

This phenomenon, labeled ``not just right experiences'' (NJREs), has increasingly been receiving attention as a possible marker of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The present study sought to add to the evidence that NJREs may be a putative endophenotype of obsessional symptoms. To this aim, measures of NJREs, obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms and psychological distress were compared in offspring of parents with and without OC symptoms. The offspring of parents with OC symptoms (N=120) reported higher frequency and severity of NJREs compared to offspring of parents without OC symptoms (N=106). Such differences remained significant for NJREs frequency and close to significance for NJREs severity, when general distress (i.e., anxiety and depression) was controlled. The possible role of NJREs as an endophenotype for OCD is discussed in reference to Gottesman and Gould criteria and the National Institute of Mental Health RDoC initiative.},

@article{milinski_working_1998,
  abstract   = {Many problems in human society reflect the inability of selfish parties to cooperate. The ``Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma'' has been used widely as a model for the evolution of cooperation in societies. Axelrod's computer tournaments and the extensive simulations of evolution by Nowak and Sigmund and others have shown that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Rigorous empirical tests, however, lag behind the progress made by theorists. Clear predictions differ depending on the players' capacity to remember previous rounds of the game. To test whether humans use the kind of cooperative strategies predicted, we asked students to play the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game either continuously or interrupted after each round by a secondary memory task (i.e., playing the game ``Memory'') that constrained the students' working-memory capacity. When playing without interruption, most students used ``Pavlovian'' strategies, as predicted, for greater memory capacity, and the rest used ``generous tit-for-tat'' strategies. The proportion of generous tit-for-tat strategies increased when games of Memory interfered with the subjects' working memory, as predicted. Students who continued to use complex Pavlovian strategies were less successful in the Memory game, but more successful in the Prisoner's Dilemma, which indicates a trade-off in memory capacity for the two tasks. Our results suggest that the set of strategies predicted by game theorists approximates human reality.},

@article{scheibehenne_expectations_2011,
  abstract   = {When predicting the next outcome in a sequence of events, people often appear to expect streaky patterns, such as that sport players can develop a ``hot hand,'' even if the sequence is actually random. This expectation, referred to as positive recency, can be adaptive in environments characterized by resources that are clustered across space or time (e.g., expecting to find multiple berries on separate bushes). But how strong is this disposition towards positive recency? If people perceive random sequences as streaky, will there be situations in which they forego a payoff because they prefer an unpredictable random environment over an exploitable but alternating pattern? To find out, 238 participants repeatedly chose to bet on the next outcome of one of two sequences of (binary) events, presented next to each other. One sequence displayed events at random while the other sequence was either more streaky (positively autocorrelated) or more alternating (negatively autocorrelated) than chance. The degree of autocorrelation varied in a between-subject design. Most people preferred to predict purely random sequences over those with moderate negative autocorrelation and thus missed the opportunity for above-chance payoff. Positive recency persisted despite extensive feedback and the opportunity to learn more rewarding behavior over time. Further, most participants' choice strategies were best described by a win-stay/lose-shift strategy, adaptive in clumpy or streaky environments. We discuss the implications regarding an evolved human tendency to expect streaky patterns, even if the sequence is actually random.},

Relations between complex EF and academic achievement were examined on a sub-sample (N=1395) given the Woodcock--Johnson Tests of Achievement--Revised (Woodcock \& Johnson, 1989). Performance on the three complex EF tasks improved until at least age 15, although improvement slowed with increasing age and varied some across tasks. Moreover, the different developmental patterns in the correlations between completion time and accuracy provide clues to developmental processes. Examination of individual achievement subtests clarified the specific aspects of academic performance most related to complex EF. Finally, the correlation between complex EF and academic achievement varied across ages, but the developmental pattern of the strength of these correlations was remarkably similar for overall math and reading achievement, suggesting a domain-general relation between complex EF and academic achievement.},

Attempts to delineate genetic contributions have met with limited success, and there is an ongoing search for intermediate trait or vulnerability markers rooted in the neurosciences. Such markers would be valuable for detecting people at risk of developing the condition, clarifying etiological factors and targeting novel treatments. This review begins with brief coverage of the epidemiology of OCD, and presents a hierarchical model of the condition. The advantages of neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging as objective measures of brain integrity and function are discussed. We describe the concept of endophenotypes and examples of their successful use in medicine and psychiatry. Key areas of focus in the search for OCD endophenotypes are identified, such as measures of inhibitory control and probes of the integrity of orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Finally, we discuss exciting findings in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with OCD that have led to the identification of several candidate endophenotypes of the disorder, with important implications for neurobiological understanding and treatment of this and related conditions.},

A close examination of cognitive and behavioural models leads to the suggestion that intrusive thoughts are best regarded as cognitive stimuli rather than responses. Cognitive responses (negative automatic thoughts) to these stimuli are typically linked to beliefs concerning responsibility or blame for harm to self or others. A cognitive-behavioural model based on this view is outlined and illustrated by clinical material derived from a case series. The model is used to explain a wide range of phenomena observed clinically, and a number of specific predictions are made. Implications for cognitive approaches to therapy are discussed.},

  abstract   = {Although previous research suggests that depressive ruminators tend to become stuck in a particular mind-set, this mental inflexibility may not always be disadvantageous; in some cases, it may facilitate active maintenance of a single task goal in the face of distraction. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested 98 college students, who differed in ruminative tendencies and dysphoria levels, on two executive-control tasks. One task emphasized fast-paced shifting between goals (letter naming), and one emphasized active goal maintenance (modified Stroop). Higher ruminative tendencies predicted more errors on the goal-shifting task but fewer errors on the goal-maintenance task; these results demonstrated that ruminative tendencies have both detrimental and beneficial effects. Moreover, although ruminative tendencies and dysphoria levels were moderately correlated (r = .42), higher dysphoria levels predicted more errors on the goal-maintenance task; this finding indicates that rumination and dysphoria can have opposing effects on executive control. Overall, these results suggest that depressive rumination reflects a trait associated with more stability (goal maintenance) than flexibility (goal shifting).},

  abstract   = {The cognitive model of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) proposes that certain beliefs may contribute to the development and maintenance of this disorder. However, the role of such beliefs in OCD symptomatology is not clear, despite many investigations conducted so far. In the effort to identify other constructs and processes related to OCD, the phenomenon labeled ``not just right experiences'' (NJREs) has been receiving increasing attention. NJREs can be defined as ``the subjective sense that something isn't just as it should be'', an unsettled feeling because something in the individuals or in the world around them is not right. In the current research, measures of NJREs, OC symptoms, general distress (i.e., anxiety, depression), and looming maladaptive style were administered to 187 college students on three occasions six months apart (baseline, six-months, and one-year later). Linear mixed effects regression models indicated that NJREs explained OC symptoms variation over time even when general distress and looming style were accounted for. Investigation of distinct OC symptoms indicated that NJREs were associated also with washing, ordering and obsessing symptoms, but not with checking ones. These findings suggest that the concept of NJREs may contribute to improve current psychological and biological model of OCD.},

Evidence suggests deficits in motor inhibition ability in OCD patients but studies using Go/Nogo paradigms show mixed results. Not just right experiences (NJREs) have been proposed to be involved in difficulties terminating compulsions. This study assesses the relationship between NJREs and Go/Nogo performance among OCD patients. Twenty-two OCD patients and 22 healthy controls matched on age, gender and education completed a battery of self-report questionnaires and a Go/Nogo task. An association was found between higher NJRE severity and slower reaction times. There was no association between OCD severity and Go/Nogo performance. OCD patients made more commission errors than healthy controls, but there were no differences on omission errors and reaction times for Go and Nogo trials. The current study supports a possible role of NJREs in the slowness characterizing OCD performance and appears promising from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.},

  abstract  = {This new edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5{\textregistered}), used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders, is the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5{\textregistered} easier to use across all settings:  The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations. The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders). Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations. The information contained in the manual is also valuable to other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists.},

It is unclear whether cognitive flexibility arises from neural substrates distinct from the executive control network (ECN) or from the interplay of nodes within this and other networks. Here we review neuroimaging studies of cognitive flexibility, focusing on set shifting and task switching. We propose that more consistent operationalization and study of cognitive flexibility is required in clinical and developmental neuroscience. We suggest that an important avenue for future research is the characterization of the relationship between neural flexibility and cognitive flexibility in typical and atypical development.},

The evidence of an association between NJREs and OCD or OC symptoms have been accumulating in the last few years, whereas there is a paucity of studies about the role of this construct in other clinical conditions considered part of the ``OCD spectrum''. In the current study, the NJRE-Q-R Severity scale (a well-validated measure of NJREs) was administered to 41 patients with OCD, 53 with hair-pulling disorder (HPD), 38 with gambling disorder (GD) and 43 with eating disorders (ED) along with measures of OC symptoms and general distress. In each group, NJREs were consistently associated with OC symptoms; moreover, the pattern of associations appeared coherent with the main clinical features of each disorder. The OCD group reported higher levels of NJREs severity than GD and ED, whereas there were no differences between the OCD and HPD groups. However, HPD patients did not have higher scores of NJREs severity than GD and ED counterparts. NJREs appear to be specific to OCD, but further study is needed to establish the role of this construct in OCD-related disorders.},

Therefore, the phenomenon labeled ``not just right experiences'' (NJREs) has increasingly been receiving attention since it captures the subjective sense that ``something isn't just as it should be''. In the present study we sought to add to the evidence that NJREs may be a putative psychological marker of OCD. To this aim, measures of NJREs, obsessive--compulsive (OC) symptoms and OC-related cognitions were completed by 382 undergraduates (43.2\% females), 318 mothers and 288 fathers. NJREs correlations between parents and children were typically in the small-medium range of magnitude and comparable to correlations both for OC beliefs and symptoms. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that fathers' (but not mothers') NJREs predicted OC symptomatology in their sons even when parents' anxiety symptoms and their level of OC-related beliefs were controlled. This relationship generally also held for single symptom dimensions such as washing, checking, ordering, and mental neutralizing symptoms. On the contrary, none of parents' psychological variables considered in the present study predicted OC symptoms in daughters. The possible role of NJREs as a marker of OCD is discussed.},

The DOCS is a 20-item measure that assesses the four dimensions of OC symptoms most reliably replicated in previous structural research. Factorial validity of the DOCS was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of 3 samples, including individuals with OC disorder, those with other anxiety disorders, and nonclinical individuals. Scores on the DOCS displayed good performance on indices of reliability and validity, as well as sensitivity to treatment and diagnostic sensitivity, and hold promise as a measure of OC symptoms in clinical and research settings.

@article{fornes-romero_induced_2017,
  abstract   = {Background and objectives
                Research on incompleteness and not-just right experiences, (INC/NJREs) indicate that some OCD symptom dimensions are motivated by these experiences rather than by anxiety. Most published data are correlational, using non-clinical individuals. This study sought to examine INC/NJREs in vivo in non-clinical and OCD individuals.
                Methods
                Study 1: Ninety-three undergraduates were randomly assigned to a INC/NJREs induction (n=44) or non-induction task (n=47). Scores on self-reports assessing INC, NJREs, OCD, Anxiety, and Depression were also recorded. Study 2: Twenty adults with OCD performed the induction task and completed the same questionnaire-packet as the non-clinical participants.
                Results
                Study 1: The induction-group scored higher on several DVs of the experimental task, as INC/NJREs and uncomfortable physical sensations predicted impulses/urges to do something. All the DVs correlated with INC, NJREs, and OCD symptoms. Anxiety was only related to suppressing difficulties of the most intense sensation. Study 2: Results were comparable to those found in non-clinical people. Induced INC/NJREs correlated with compulsions severity and were associated with ordering, washing, and hoarding symptoms. OCDs did not differ from non-clinical subjects in the number of induced INC/NJREs, but they were more disturbing, difficult to suppress, and instigated more urges to do in OCDs.
                Limitations
                The small group of OCDs and the lack of a non-OCD clinical group kept us from drawing conclusions about the specificity of INC/NJREs to some OCD symptoms.
                Conclusions
                Findings support the role of INC/NJREs as stimuli triggering urges and/impulses to do and their impact on OCD severity.},

@article{hasler_discovering_2004,
  abstract   = {The limited success of genetic studies of major depression has raised questions concerning the definition of genetically relevant phenotypes. This paper presents strategies to improve the phenotypic definition of major depression by proposing endophenotypes at two levels: First, dissecting the depressive phenotype into key components results in narrow definitions of putative psychopathological endophenotypes: mood bias toward negative emotions, impaired reward function, impaired learning and memory, neurovegetative signs, impaired diurnal variation, impaired executive cognitive function, psychomotor change, and increased stress sensitivity. A review of the recent literature on neurobiological and genetic findings associated with these components is given. Second, the most consistent heritable biological markers of major depression are proposed as biological endophenotypes for genetic studies: REM sleep abnormalities, functional and structural brain abnormalities, dysfunctions in serotonergic, catecholaminergic, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and CRH systems, and intracellular signal transduction endophenotypes. The associations among the psychopathological and biological endophenotypes are discussed with respect to specificity, temporal stability, heritability, familiality, and clinical and biological plausibility. Finally, the case is made for the development of a new classification system in order to reduce the heterogeneity of depression representing a major impediment to elucidating the genetic and neurobiological basis of this common, severe, and often life-threatening illness.},

  abstract   = {Endophenotypes, measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward---and successful---genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models. The authors discuss the etymology and strategy behind the use of endophenotypes in neuropsychiatric research and, more generally, in research on other diseases with complex genetics.},

  abstract   = {Analogue samples are often used to study obsessive--compulsive (OC) symptoms and related phenomena. This approach is based on the hypothesis that results derived from such samples are relevant to understanding OC symptoms in individuals with a diagnosis of obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD). Two decades ago, Gibbs (1996) reviewed the available literature and found initial support for this hypothesis. Since then there have been many important advances addressing this issue. The purpose of the present review was to synthesize various lines of research examining the assumptions of using analogue samples to draw inferences about people with OCD. We reviewed research on the prevalence of OC symptoms in non-clinical populations, the dimensional (vs. categorical) nature of these symptoms, phenomenology, etiology, and studies on developmental and maintenance factors in clinical and analogue samples. We also considered the relevance of analogue samples in OCD treatment research. The available evidence suggests research with analogue samples is highly relevant for understanding OC symptoms. Guidelines for the appropriate use of analogue designs and samples are suggested.},

@article{cosmides_are_1996,
  abstract   = {Professional probabilists have long argued over what probability means, with, for example, Bayesians arguing that probabilities refer to subjective degrees of confidence and frequentists arguing that probabilities refer to the frequencies of events in the world. Recently, Gigerenzer and his colleagues have argued that these same distinctions are made by untutored subjects, and that, for many domains, the human mind represents probabilistic information as frequencies. We analyze several reasons why, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, certain classes of problem-solving mechanisms in the human mind should be expected to represent probabilistic information as frequencies. Then, using a problem famous in the ``heuristics and biases'' literature for eliciting base rate neglect, we show that correct Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in 76\% of subjects - indeed, 92\% in the most ecologically valid condition - simply by expressing the problem in frequentist terms. This result adds to the growing body of literature showing that frequentist representations cause various cognitive biases to disappear, including overconfidence, the conjunction fallacy, and base-rate neglect. Taken together, these new findings indicate that the conclusion most common in the literature on judgment under uncertainty - that our inductive reasoning mechanisms do not embody a calculus of probability - will have to be re-examined. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, humans may turn out to be good intuitive statisticians after all.},

@article{gillan_disruption_2011,
  abstract   = {Objective:Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors and thought patterns. Although patients with OCD report that these compulsive behaviors are unproductive and often senseless, they are unable to desist. This study investigated whether the urge to perform compulsive acts is mediated by a disruption in the balance between flexible, goal-directed action control and habitual behavior.Method:A total of 21 patients with OCD and 30 healthy comparison subjects participated in a set of tasks designed to assess relative goal-directed versus habitual behavioral control. In the training stage, participants were asked to respond to different pictured stimuli in order to gain rewarding outcomes. In the subsequent (instructed) outcome devaluation test and in a novel ``slips-of-action'' test, the authors assessed whether participants were able to flexibly adjust their behavior to changes in the desirability of the outcomes. The authors also used a questionnaire to test explicit knowledge of the relationships between stimuli, responses, and outcomes.Results:Patients with OCD showed no deficit in their ability to use feedback to respond appropriately to stimuli in the training stage. However, their knowledge of the outcomes of these responses was impaired relative to healthy comparison subjects, and patients were more prone to slips of action, indicating a deficit in goal-directed control and an overreliance on habits.Conclusions:This study provides the first experimental evidence for selective impairment in flexible and goal-directed behavioral control in patients with OCD. The impairment forces patients with OCD to rely instead on habits that can be triggered by stimuli regardless of the desirability of the consequences. Goal-directed actions are supported by orbitofronto-striatal circuitry, and the study findings are thus in line with findings from research that implicate dysfunction in this circuitry in the neuropathology of OCD.},

  abstract   = {Our decisions are based on parallel and competing systems of goal-directed and habitual learning, systems which can be impaired in pathological behaviours. Here we focus on the influence of motivation and compare reward and loss outcomes in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) on model-based goal-directed and model-free habitual behaviours using the two-step task. We further investigate the relationship with acquisition learning using a one-step probabilistic learning task. Forty-eight OCD subjects and 96 healthy volunteers were tested on a reward and 30 OCD subjects and 53 healthy volunteers on the loss version of the two-step task. Thirty-six OCD subjects and 72 healthy volunteers were also tested on a one-step reversal task. OCD subjects compared with healthy volunteers were less goal oriented (model-based) and more habitual (model-free) to reward outcomes with a shift towards greater model-based and lower habitual choices to loss outcomes. OCD subjects also had enhanced acquisition learning to loss outcomes on the one-step task, which correlated with goal-directed learning in the two-step task. OCD subjects had greater stay behaviours or perseveration in the one-step task irrespective of outcome. Compulsion severity was correlated with habitual learning in the reward condition. Obsession severity was correlated with greater switching after loss outcomes. In healthy volunteers, we further show that greater reward magnitudes are associated with a shift towards greater goal-directed learning further emphasizing the role of outcome salience. Our results highlight an important influence of motivation on learning processes in OCD and suggest that distinct clinical strategies based on valence may be warranted.},

The correlation between a latent intelligence trait (Spearman's g from CAT2E) and a latent trait of educational achievement (GCSE scores) was 0.81. General intelligence contributed to success on all 25 subjects. Variance accounted for ranged from 58.6\% in Mathematics and 48\% in English to 18.1\% in Art and Design. Girls showed no advantage in g, but performed significantly better on all subjects except Physics. This was not due to their better verbal ability. At age 16, obtaining five or more GCSEs at grades A⁎--C is an important criterion. 61\% of girls and 50\% of boys achieved this. For those at the mean level of g at age 11, 58\% achieved this; a standard deviation increase or decrease in g altered the values to 91\% and 16\%, respectively.},

Although this approach has improved reliability of categorization, its validity and utility has been questioned (Harvey, Watkins, Mansell, \& Shafran, 2004; Insel et al., 2009; Sanislow et al., 2010). Limitations include high comorbidity between supposedly distinct disorders; heterogeneity within diagnoses; limited treatment efficacy; and similarities across disorders in aetiology, latent symptom structure, and underlying biology. There is also evidence of transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural processes (Harvey et al., 2004). An alternative approach is therefore to focus on fundamental underlying mechanisms of psychopathology rather than observed symptom clusters. This article considers the possible benefits, hurdles, and steps towards implementation of this transdiagnostic mechanistic approach, using the example of repetitive negative thought.},

  abstract   = {Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has established itself as one of the most effective therapies for treating a wide range of psychological disorders. However, research and treatment in this field typically adopts a DSM driven 'disorder-focused' approach - researchers and clinicians target aspecific disorder, try to understand its aetiology and maintenance, and try to develop more effective strategies to treat the disorder. This book proposes an insightful and original approach to understanding these disorders, one that focuses on what they have in common. Instead of examining in isolation, for example, obsessive compulsive disorders, insomnia, schizophrenia, it asks - what do patients with these disorders have incommon? It takes each cognitive and behavioural process - attention, memory, reasoning, thought, behaviour, and examines whether it is a transdiagnostic process - i.e., serves to maintain a broad range of psychological disorders. Having shown how these disorders share several important processes,it then describes the practical implications of such an approach to diagnosis and treatment. Importantly it explores why the different psychological disorders can present so differently, despite being maintained by the same cognitive and behavioural processes. It also provides an account of the highrates of comorbidity observed among the different disorders. This book provides a novel review and integration of the empirical literature and gives clinicians and researchers a valuable new theoretical base for assessing and treating psychological disorders.},

  abstract   = {Objective:           OCD is a clinically heterogeneous condition. This heterogeneity has the potential to reduce power in genetic, neuroimaging, and clinical trials. Despite a mounting number of studies, there remains debate regarding the exact factor structure of OCD symptoms. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to determine the factor structure of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist.           Method:           Studies were included if they involved subjects with OCD and included an exploratory factor analysis of the 13 Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist categories or the items therein. A varimax-rotation was conducted in SAS 9.1 using the PROC FACTOR CORR to extract factors from sample-size weighted co-occurrence matrices. Stratified meta-analysis was conducted to determine the factor structure of OCD in studies involving children and adults separately.           Results:           Twenty-one studies involving 5,124 participants were included. The four factors generated were 1) symmetry: symmetry obsessions and repeating, ordering, and counting compulsions; 2) forbidden thoughts: aggression, sexual, religious, and somatic obsessions and checking compulsions, 3) cleaning: cleaning and contamination, and 4) hoarding: hoarding obsessions and compulsions. Factor analysis of studies including adults yielded an identical factor structure compared to the overall meta-analysis. Factor analysis of child-only studies differed in that checking loaded highest on the symmetry factor and somatic obsessions, on the cleaning factor.           Conclusions:           A four-factor structure explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity in the clinical symptoms of OCD. Further item-level factor analyses are needed to determine the appropriate placement of miscellaneous somatic and checking OCD symptoms.},

  abstract  = {Personality assessment remains the field's most commonly used mode of assessment. Despite its popularity and demonstrated utility, the self-report method has been a frequent target of criticism from the early days of psychological assessment right up to the present. The psychological processes underlying an act of self-reporting are now understood to be exceedingly complex. Examination of these processes requires burrowing deep into the affective and cognitive substrates of personality. Among the challenging issues are the role of motives in self-perception, the applicability of performative models, the effectiveness of introspection, the degree of automaticity, and the meaning of nonresponding. The goal of this chapter is more limited: to provide a brief guide to nonexpert researchers interested in using the self-report method to assess personality. We begin by delineating three categories of self-reports. We then review the advantages and the disadvantages of the self-report method. Next, we examine the convergence of self-reports with other methods of assessing personality. Finally, we provide a practical guide to choosing a self-report instrument.

  abstract   = {The heart of the obsessional process may be considered the subject's underlying impression that ``something is wrong'' or ``that something is not just as it should be''. This phenomenon, labeled ``not just right experiences'' (NJREs), has increasingly been receiving attention as a possible marker of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The present study sought to add to the evidence that NJREs may be a putative endophenotype of obsessional symptoms. To this aim, measures of NJREs, obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms and psychological distress were compared in offspring of parents with and without OC symptoms. The offspring of parents with OC symptoms (N=120) reported higher frequency and severity of NJREs compared to offspring of parents without OC symptoms (N=106). Such differences remained significant for NJREs frequency and close to significance for NJREs severity, when general distress (i.e., anxiety and depression) was controlled. The possible role of NJREs as an endophenotype for OCD is discussed in reference to Gottesman and Gould criteria and the National Institute of Mental Health RDoC initiative.},

@article{gottesman_endophenotype_2003-1,
  abstract   = {Endophenotypes, measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward---and successful---genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models. The authors discuss the etymology and strategy behind the use of endophenotypes in neuropsychiatric research and, more generally, in research on other diseases with complex genetics.},

  abstract   = {Background: Current neurobiological models of obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD) propose a dysfunction of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits that leads to enhanced activity in frontal and striatal brain regions. In accordance with that, OCD patients show alterations in learning and flexible adaptation to changing task requirements. The purpose of this study was to examine feedback-based learning and to investigate whether learning from positive and negative feedback is differentially altered in OCD. Methods: In this study, 18 OCD patients and 18 healthy comparison subjects conducted a probabilistic selection task. The task consisted of an acquisition and a test phase and allowed disentangling the extent of learning based on positive and negative feedback. Results: Groups did not differ during probabilistic feedback learning in the acquisition phase. In the test phase, OCD patients showed a negative learning bias in contrast to comparison subjects who showed a positive learning bias. Patients were better at avoiding stimuli that were initially associated with negative outcomes than at approaching stimuli that were associated with positive feedbacks. This interaction was also found for reaction times in that patients were faster in avoiding negative and slower in approaching positive stimuli. Conclusion: Enhanced avoidance learning was found in OCD patients that points to exaggerated anticipation and avoidance of aversive outcomes. Further studies are required to investigate whether neurobiological mechanisms, such as dopaminergic signaling or outcome processing, in the orbitofrontal cortex relate to enhanced negative learning in OCD.

@article{grundler_task-related_2009,
  abstract   = {Hyperactive cortico-striatal circuits including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have been implicated to underlie obtrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors in obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD). Larger error-related negativities (ERNs) in OCD patients during simple flanker tasks have been proposed to reflect an amplified error signal in these hyperactive circuits. Such amplified error signals typically are associated with an adaptive change in response, yet in OCD these same repetitive responses persist to the point of distress and impairment. In contrast to this repetitive character of OC behavior, larger ERN amplitudes have been linked to better avoidance learning in reinforcement learning tasks. Study I thus investigated if OC symptomatology in non-patients predicted an enhanced ERN after suboptimal choices in a probabilistic learning task. Absent any behavioral differences, higher OC symptoms predicted smaller ERNs. Study II replicated this effect in an independent sample while also replicating findings of a larger ERN in a flanker task. There were no relevant behavioral differences in reinforcement learning or error monitoring as a function of symptom score. These findings implicate different, yet overlapping neural mechanisms underlying the negative deflection in the ERP following the execution of an erroneous motor response and the one following a suboptimal choice in a reinforcement learning paradigm. OC symptomatology may be dissociated in these neural systems, with hypoactivity in a system that enables learning to avoid maladaptive choices, and hyperactivity in another system that enables the same behavior to be repeated when it was assessed as not quite good enough the first time.},

  abstract   = {The purpose of this study was to examine the basic psychometric proprieties of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) and its measurement invariance across sex, BMI-status (normal weight/overweight), and age in a community sample of 990 Italian adults. The analysis of the dimensionality of the DEBQ using exploratory factor analysis revealed the existence of three major factors -- emotional, restrained and external eating. Single and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses replicated the three-factor structure, and this dimensional structure proved to be invariant across sex, BMI-status, and age. Findings upheld the criterion-related validity (e.g., via its associations with Eating Attitudes Test-26). The DEBQ's subscales displayed high internal consistency and test--retest reliability over a 4-week period. Statistically significant differences were found when sex, BMI and age groups are compared in the latent means of emotional, external and restrained eating and they are discussed with reference to theory, past and recent empirical findings. Overall, results support the measurement invariance of the DEBQ and suggest that the Italian version is a psychometrically reliable, valid and useful measurement instrument for assessing adult eating behaviors.},

  abstract   = {Purpose
                Bayesian multilevel models are increasingly used to overcome the limitations of frequentist
                approaches in the analysis of complex structured data. This tutorial introduces Bayesian
                multilevel modeling for the specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package
                developed in R.
                
                
                Method
                In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian multilevel modeling
                by reanalyzing a phonetic data set containing formant (F1 and F2) values for 5 vowels
                of standard Indonesian (ISO 639-3:ind), as spoken by 8 speakers (4 females and 4 males),
                with several repetitions of each vowel.
                
                
                Results
                We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modeling.
                We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic
                programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula
                syntax.
                
                
                Conclusions
                Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework
                for statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code
                for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).

In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

                   Methods: The sample included 2436 female inpatients treated between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2000, for primary DSM-IV diagnoses of anorexia, bulimia, and eating disorder not otherwise specified. Analyses were multivariate analysis of variance and multinomial logistic regression; sociodemographics and severity-of-illness measures were controlled.
                   Results: Ninety-seven percent of patients evidenced ≥1 comorbid diagnoses; 94\% evidenced comorbid mood disorders, largely unipolar depression, with no differences across eating disorders; 56\% evidenced anxiety disorders, with no differences across eating disorders; and 22\% evidenced substance use disorders, with significant differences across eating disorders (p {\textless} .0001). Five specific diagnoses differed across eating disorders. Alcohol abuse/dependence was twice as likely with bulimia (p {\textless} .0001); polysubstance abuse/dependence three times as likely with bulimia (p {\textless} .0001); obsessive-compulsive disorder twice as likely with restricting and binge/purge anorexia (p {\textless} .01); posttraumatic stress disorder twice as likely with binge-purge anorexia (p {\textless} .05); schizophrenia/other psychoses three times more likely with restricting anorexia (p {\textless} .05) and two times with binge-purge anorexia (p {\textless} .05).
                   Conclusions: New findings emerged: extremely high comorbidity regardless of eating disorder, ubiquitous depression across all eating disorders, no difference in overall rate of anxiety disorders across eating disorders, greater posttraumatic stress disorder in binge-purge anorexia, more psychotic diagnoses in anorexia. Certain previous findings were confirmed: more obsessive-compulsive disorder in anorexia; more substance use in bulimia; and a replicated comorbidity rank-ordering for eating disorder patients: mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, respectively.

  abstract      = {Purpose of review Eating disorders -- anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder -- affect numerous Europeans. This narrative review summarizes European studies on their prevalence, incidence, comorbidity, course, consequences, and risk factors published in 2015 and the first half of 2016.
                   Recent findings Anorexia nervosa is reported by {\textless}1--4\%, bulimia nervosa {\textless}1--2\%, binge eating disorder {\textless}1--4\%, and subthreshold eating disorders by 2--3\% of women in Europe. Of men, 0.3--0.7\% report eating disorders. Incidences of anorexia appear stable, whereas bulimia may be declining. Although the numbers of individuals receiving treatment have increased, only about one-third is detected by healthcare. Over 70\% of individuals with eating disorders report comorbid disorders: anxiety disorders ({\textgreater}50\%), mood disorders ({\textgreater}40\%), self-harm ({\textgreater}20\%), and substance use ({\textgreater}10\%) are common. The long-term course of anorexia nervosa is favorable for most, but a substantial minority of eating disorder patients experience longstanding symptoms and somatic problems. The risk of suicide is elevated. Parental psychiatric disorders, prenatal maternal stress, various family factors, childhood overweight, and body dissatisfaction in adolescence increase the risk of eating disorders.
                   Summary Eating disorders are relatively common disorders that are often overlooked, although they are associated with high comorbidity and serious health consequences.},

  abstract      = {Objective The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimic disorders has been established in research trials. This study examined whether that efficacy can be translated into effectiveness in routine clinical practice. Method Seventy-eight adult women with bulimic disorders (bulimia nervosa and atypical bulimia nervosa) undertook individual CBT, with few exclusion criteria and a treatment protocol based on evidence-based approaches, utilizing individualized formulations. Patients completed measures of eating behaviors, eating attitudes, and depression pre- and post-treatment. Eight patients dropped out. The mean number of sessions attended was 19.2. Results No pretreatment features predicted drop-out. Treatment outcome was similar whether using treatment completer or intent to treat analyses. Approximately 50\% of patients were in remission by the end of treatment. There were significant improvements in mood, eating attitudes, and eating behaviors. Reductions in bingeing and vomiting were comparable to efficacy trials. Discussion The improvements in this ``real-world'' trial of CBT for adults with bulimic disorders mirrored those from large, funded research trials, though the conclusions that can be reached are inevitably limited by the nature of the trial (e.g., lack of control group and therapy validation). {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract      = {Objective In recent years there has been increasing clinical and empirical interest in neurocognitive functioning in eating disorders (EDs), which has resulted in numerous quantitative and qualitative reviews. However, there has yet to be a comprehensive synthesis or critical review of this literature to identify future directions to advance the field in this area. Therefore the aim of this systematic review of systematic reviews was to (a) characterize the existing literature on neurocognitive functioning in EDs based on recent reviews (i.e., published since 2010), (b) describe related limitations, and (c) suggest avenues for future research to address gaps in the current literature. Method Electronic databases were queried for reviews of neurocognitive domains (i.e., inhibitory control, decision-making, central coherence, set-shifting, working memory, and attention bias) in EDs, which identified 28 systematic and meta-analytic reviews. Results Broadly, the literature indicates deficits across these neurocognitive domains in EDs, though heterogeneity was noted in the magnitude of these effects, which varied to some extent across ED subtypes, sample characteristics, and methodological approaches. Discussion While these reviews have generally suggested varying patterns of neurocognitive deficits across EDs, there remain critical limitations regarding the methodological quality of these studies (e.g., the lack of prospective designs, consideration of confounding influences, or examination of interrelationships between neurocognitive domains and relationships between neurocognition and other relevant behavioral constructs). Specifically, we outline 10 key areas that are imperative to address in future research in this area in order to move our field forward.},

@article{verharen_insensitivity_2019,
  abstract      = {Background
                   Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) demonstrate aberrations in choice behavior, including impairments in laboratory measures of decision making. Although a wealth of studies suggest that these aberrations arise from alterations in value processing, it remains unclear by which core component of value processing this is mediated.
                   Methods
                   We fit trial-by-trial data of patients with AN (n = 60 first cohort, n = 216 second cohort) and healthy control participants (n = 55) performing the Iowa Gambling Task to a computational model based on prospect utility theory. We determined, per participant, the best-fit model parameters and compared these between the groups.
                   Results
                   Analyses revealed a decreased estimate of model parameter λ in patients with AN, indicative of an attenuation of loss-aversive behavior in the Iowa Gambling Task. In comparison, measures of reward sensitivity, value-based learning, and exploration versus exploitation were unaltered in patients with AN. A measurement in a second independent cohort replicated the finding that loss aversion, typically observed in healthy individuals, is reduced in patients with AN.
                   Conclusions
                   We show that patients with AN, in contrast to healthy control participants, demonstrate reduced loss-aversive behavior. This finding provides important fundamental insights into the decision-making capacity of patients with AN, suggesting alterations in the mechanisms involved in value processing related to negative feedback.},

An abbreviated 26-item version of the EAT (EAT-26) is proposed, based on a factor analysis of the original scale (EAT-40). The EAT-26 is highly correlated with the EAT-40 (r = 0·98) and three factors form subscales which are meaningfully related to bulimia, weight, body-image variables and psychological symptoms. Whereas there are no differces between bulimic and restricter anorexia nervosa patients on the total EAT-26 and EAT-40 scores, these groups do indicate significant differences on EAT-26 fractors. Norms for the anorexia nervosa and female comparison subjects are presented for the EAT-26, EAT-40 and the EAT-26 factors. It is concluded that the EAT-26 is a reliable, valid and economical instrument which may be useful as an objective measure of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa.},

  abstract   = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our behaviour is shaped by its consequences -- we seek rewards and avoid harm. It has been reported that individuals vary markedly in their avoidance of detrimental consequences, i.e. in their sensitivity to punishment. The underpinnings of this variability are poorly understood; they may be driven by differences in aversion sensitivity, motivation for reward, and/or instrumental control. We examined these hypotheses by applying several analysis strategies to the behaviour of rats (n = 48; 18 female) trained in a task permitting concurrent assessment of punishment, reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We show that punishment insensitivity is a unique phenotype, unrelated to differences in reward-seeking and Pavlovian fear, and due to a failure of instrumental control. Subjects insensitive to punishment are afraid of aversive events, they are simply unable to change their behaviour to avoid them.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The sample was subdivided into four groups according to inferential style and responsivity to sad mood induction. Following a sad mood induction, we examined the effect on working memory of an incidental association between facial affect, facial identity, and head-pose orientation. Overall, head-pose recognition was more accurate for the self-face than for nonself face (self-face advantage, SFA). However, participants high in negative cognitive style who experienced higher levels of sadness displayed a stronger SFA for sad expressions than happy expressions. The remaining participants displayed an opposite bias (a stronger SFA for happy expressions than sad expressions), or no bias. These findings highlight the importance of trait-vulnerability status in the working memory biases related to emotional facial expressions.},

  abstract   = {The cognitive model of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) proposes that certain beliefs may contribute to the development and maintenance of this disorder. However, the role of such beliefs in OCD symptomatology is not clear, despite many investigations conducted so far. In the effort to identify other constructs and processes related to OCD, the phenomenon labeled ``not just right experiences'' (NJREs) has been receiving increasing attention. NJREs can be defined as ``the subjective sense that something isn't just as it should be'', an unsettled feeling because something in the individuals or in the world around them is not right. In the current research, measures of NJREs, OC symptoms, general distress (i.e., anxiety, depression), and looming maladaptive style were administered to 187 college students on three occasions six months apart (baseline, six-months, and one-year later). Linear mixed effects regression models indicated that NJREs explained OC symptoms variation over time even when general distress and looming style were accounted for. Investigation of distinct OC symptoms indicated that NJREs were associated also with washing, ordering and obsessing symptoms, but not with checking ones. These findings suggest that the concept of NJREs may contribute to improve current psychological and biological model of OCD.},

  abstract   = {Objective: To study the predictors of new eating disorders in an adolescent cohort.
                Design: Cohort study over 3 years with six waves.
                Subjects: Students, initially aged 14-15 years, from 44 secondary schools in the state of Victoria, Australia.
                Outcome measures: Weight (kg), height (cm), dieting (adolescent dieting scale), psychiatric morbidity (revised clinical interview schedule), and eating disorder (branched eating disorders test). Eating disorder (partial syndrome) was defined when a subject met two criteria for either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV).
                Results: At the start of the study, 3.3\% (29/888) of female subjects and 0.3\% (2/811) of male subjects had partial syndromes of eating disorders. The rate of development of new eating disorder per 1000 person years of observation was 21.8 in female subjects and 6.0 in male subjects. Female subjects who dieted at a severe level were 18 times more likely to develop an eating disorder than those who did not diet, and female subjects who dieted at a moderate level were five times more likely to develop an eating disorder than those who did not diet. Psychiatric morbidity predicted the onset of eating disorder independently of dieting status so that those subjects in the highest morbidity category had an almost sevenfold increased risk of developing an eating disorder. After adjustment for earlier dieting and psychiatric morbidity, body mass index, extent of exercise, and sex were not predictive of new eating disorders.
                Conclusions: Dieting is the most important predictor of new eating disorders. Differences in the incidence of eating disorders between sexes were largely accounted for by the high rates of earlier dieting and psychiatric morbidity in the female subjects. In adolescents, controlling weight by exercise rather than diet restriction seems to carry less risk of development of eating disorders.
                
                Key messages Adolescent females who diet at a severe level are 18 times more likely to develop an eating disorder than those who do not diet, and those who diet at a moderate level are five times more likely to develop an eating disorderHigh levels of psychiatric morbidity in females increase the risk of developing eating disorders by sevenfoldAround two thirds of new cases of eating disorder arise in females who have dieted moderatelyThe predominance of eating disorders in females is largely explained by the higher rates of earlier dieting and psychiatric morbidityDaily exercise seems to be a less risky strategy for controlling weight in adolescents},

  abstract   = {Objective
                Research on the manifestations and health correlates of eating disorder symptoms among males is lacking. This study identified patterns of appearance concerns and eating disorder behaviors from adolescence through young adulthood and their health correlates.
                Method
                Participants were 7,067 males from the prospective Growing Up Today Study. Surveys from 1999 to 2007 (spanning ages 13−26 years) provided repeated measures data on muscularity and leanness concerns, eating disorder behaviors (purging, overeating, binge eating, use of muscle-building products), and health correlates (obesity, non-marijuana drug use, binge drinking, and depressive symptoms).
                Results
                Latent class analyses of observations at ages 13 to 15, 16 to 18, 19 to 22, and 23 to 26 years identified 1 large Asymptomatic class and 4 symptomatic patterns: Body Image Disturbance (high appearance concerns, low eating disorder behaviors; 1.0\%−6.0\% per age period); Binge Eating/Purging (binge eating and purging, use of muscle-building products, low appearance concerns; 0.1\%−2.5\%); Mostly Asymptomatic (low levels of muscularity concern, product use, and overeating; 3.5\%−5.0\%); and Muscularity Concerns (high muscularity concerns and use of products; 0.6\%−1.0\%). The Body Image Disturbance class was associated with high estimated prevalence of depressive symptoms. Males in the Binge Eating/Purging and Muscularity Concerns classes had high prevalence of binge drinking and drug use. Despite exhibiting modestly greater appearance concerns and eating disorder behaviors than the Asymptomatic class, being in the Mostly Asymptomatic class was prospectively associated with adverse health outcomes.
                Conclusion
                Results underscore the importance of measuring concerns about leanness, muscularity, and use of muscle-building products when assessing eating disorder presentations among males in research and clinical settings.},

@article{bernardoni_nutritional_2018,
  abstract      = {Background
                   Cortical folding is thought to remain relatively invariant after birth. Therefore, differences seen in psychiatric disorders have been proposed as early biomarkers or used as intermediate phenotypes in imaging genetics studies. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with drastic and rapid structural brain alterations and thus may be an ideal model disorder to study environmental influences on cortical folding.
                   Methods
                   To date, the only two studies in AN applied different methods (local gyrification index and mean curvature) and found seemingly discordant results. We computed both vertexwise measures in a sizable sample of acutely underweight female AN patients (n = 87, mean age 16.5 years), long-term recovered patients (n = 58, mean age 22 years), and healthy control participants (n = 141, mean age 19.5 years). The majority of acutely ill patients were scanned longitudinally (n = 57) again after partial weight normalization ({\textgreater}14\% body mass index increase).
                   Results
                   While gyrification was broadly reduced in acutely ill patients, normal values were restored in most brain regions after partial weight restoration (≈3 months), and after full recovery no significant differences were evident relative to control participants. Increased gyrification was largely predicted by weight restoration alone. Results for absolute mean curvature analyses complemented those obtained using the local gyrification index.
                   Conclusions
                   Together, these findings indicate that nutritional status affects cortical folding and suggest that gyrification studies may need to better control for environmental factors. Moreover, they provide novel support for the likelihood that macroscopic changes in the cortical organization in AN are more reflective of nutritional state than premorbid trait markers or permanent scars.},

@article{ohara_reward-centred_2015,
  abstract      = {This focussed narrative review examines neurobiological and psychophysiological evidence supporting a role for altered reward processes in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). In AN, there does not appear to be a generalised inability to experience reward. Rather, data suggest that a reluctance to gain weight leads to an aversive appraisal of food- and taste-related stimuli. As a result, cues compatible with this aberrant mode of thinking become rewarding for the individual. Evidence also suggests that attribution of motivational salience to such cues promotes anorectic behaviours. These findings are consistent with models in which interactions between cognition and reward are important in eliciting the anorectic ``habit''. A model is proposed which is consistent with elements of other theoretical frameworks, but differs in that its emphasis is towards neural overlaps between AN and addiction. It is consistent with AN being a reward-based learned behaviour in which aberrant cognitions related to eating and shape alter functioning of central reward systems. It proposes that the primary neural problem responsible for the development, maintenance, and treatment resistance is centred in the striatal reward system. This helps shift the emphasis of aetiological models towards reward processing, particularly in the context of illness-compatible cues. Furthermore, it suggests that continuing to explore the utility and valued nature of AN in the patient's life would be a useful inclusion in treatment and prevention models.},

@article{kaye_nothing_2013,
  abstract      = {Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in relentless restrictive eating and often become severely emaciated. Because there are no proven treatments, AN has high rates of relapse, chronicity, and death. Those with AN tend to have childhood temperament and personality traits, such as anxiety, obsessions, and perfectionism, which may reflect neurobiological risk factors for developing AN. Restricted eating may be a means of reducing negative mood caused by skewed interactions between serotonin aversive or inhibitory and dopamine reward systems. Brain imaging studies suggest that altered eating is a consequence of dysregulated reward and/or awareness of homeostatic needs, perhaps related to enhanced executive ability to inhibit incentive motivational drives. An understanding of the neurobiology of this disorder is likely to be important for developing more effective treatments.},

  abstract      = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with exaggerated self-control and altered reward-based decision making, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. Consistent with the notion of excessive cognitive control, we recently found increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation in acutely ill patients (acAN) on lose-shift trials in a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task. However, undernutrition may modulate brain function. In attempt to disentangle trait from state factors, the current fMRI study investigated cognitive control in recovered patients (recAN). Thirty-one recAN and 31 healthy controls (HC) completed a PRL task during fMRI. Based on previous findings, we focused on hemodynamic responses during lose-shift behaviour and conducted supplementary functional connectivity analysis. RecAN showed elevated lose-shift behaviour relative to HC. On the neural level, recAN showed normal dACC responses, but increased activation in fronto-parietal control regions. A trend for increased coupling between frontal and parietal regions of interest was also evident in recAN. The current findings in recAN differ from those in our previous study in acAN. While aberrant dACC response to negative feedback may be a correlate of the underweight state in acAN, impaired behavioural adaptation and elevated activation of cognitive control regions in recAN is suggestive of altered neural efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Background
                   In their relentless pursuit of thinness, individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in maladaptive behaviors (restrictive food choices and overexercising) that may originate in altered decision making and learning.
                   Methods
                   In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we employed computational modeling to elucidate the neural correlates of feedback learning and value-based decision making in 36 female patients with AN and 36 age-matched healthy volunteers (12--24 years). Participants performed a decision task that required adaptation to changing reward contingencies. Data were analyzed within a hierarchical Gaussian filter model that captures interindividual variability in learning under uncertainty.
                   Results
                   Behaviorally, patients displayed an increased learning rate specifically after punishments. At the neural level, hemodynamic correlates for the learning rate, expected value, and prediction error did not differ between the groups. However, activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex was elevated in AN following punishment.
                   Conclusions
                   Our findings suggest that the neural underpinning of feedback learning is selectively altered for punishment in AN.},

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural correlates of behavioural adaptation to changes in reward contingencies in young acutely ill AN patients. Thirty-six adolescent/young adult, non-chronic female AN patients and 36 age-matched healthy females completed a well-established probabilistic reversal learning task during fMRI. We analysed hemodynamic responses in empirically-defined regions of interest during positive feedback and negative feedback not followed/followed by behavioural adaptation and conducted functional connectivity analyses. Although overall task performance was comparable between groups, AN showed increased shifting after receiving negative feedback (lose-shift behaviour) and altered dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) responses as a function of feedback. Specifically, patients had increased dACC responses (which correlated with perfectionism) and task-related coupling with amygdala preceding behavioural adaption. Given the generally preserved task performance in young AN, elevated dACC responses specifically during behavioural adaption is suggestive of increased monitoring for the need to adjust performance strategies. Higher dACC-amygdala coupling and increased adaptation after negative feedback underlines this interpretation and could be related to intolerance of uncertainty which has been suggested for AN.},

However, it remains unclear how a heightened vulnerability to psychiatric disorder relates to brain maturation, and what the underlying mechanisms might be. Here, we propose `developmental computational psychiatry' as a framework for linking brain maturation to cognitive development. We propose that through modelling some of the brain's fundamental cognitive computations and relating them to brain development, we can bridge the gap between brain and cognitive development. This in turn can lead to a richer understanding of the ontogeny of psychiatric disorders. We illustrate this perspective by taking examples from reinforcement learning (RL) and dopamine function, showing how computational modelling deepens an understanding of  how cognitive processes, such as reward learning, effort learning, and social evaluation might go awry in psychiatric disorders. Finally, we formulate testable hypotheses and sketch the potential and limitations of developmental computational psychiatry.},

  abstract   = {BackgroundThe community prevalence of eating disorders among Chinese young women may now be similar to their western counterparts.AimTo investigate the prevalence of eating disorders (ED) in female university students in Wuhan, China, using a two-stage design.MethodIn stage one, 99.1 \% (N = 8,444) of eligible students (N = 8,521) completed the eating disorder inventory-1 (EDI-1) and a survey of relevant anthropomorphic data. A total of 421 women scored above the cut-off for EDE-1, as defined by a set of criteria similar to those of Keski-Rahkonen (Int J Eat Disord 39:754--762, 2006). 257 (61 \%) of these case-positive women and a random sample of case-negative women (312 out of 8,023, 4 \%) whose scores did not exceed the defined cut-off were interviewed using the eating disorder examination (EDE) and the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders (SCID-I).ResultsOn interview with the SCID-I, 79 women were diagnosed with an ED. Among them, 10 had anorexia nervosa (AN), 21 bulimia nervosa (BN), and 48 binge eating disorder (BED) The results showed a prevalence rate of 1.05 \% (95 \% CI = 0.02--2.08) for AN, 2.98 \% (95 \% CI = 1.21--4.74) for BN, and 3.53 \% (95 \% CI = 1.75--5.30) for BED.ConclusionThe prevalence of ED among female university students in China is now similar to that of their western counterparts, and BED is the most common ED followed by BN and AN similarly.},

@article{zhang_impaired_2014,
  abstract      = {Obesity is a major epidemic in many parts of the world. One of the main factors contributing to obesity is overconsumption of high-fat and high-calorie food [1], which is driven by the rewarding properties of these types of food [2, 3]. Previous studies have suggested that dysfunction in reward circuits may be associated with overeating and obesity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The nature of this dysfunction, however, is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate impairment in reward-based associative learning specific to food in obese women. Normal-weight and obese participants performed an appetitive reversal learning task in which they had to learn and modify cue-reward associations. To test whether any learning deficits were specific to food reward or were more general, we used a between-subject design in which half of the participants received food reward and the other half received money reward. Our results reveal a marked difference in associative learning between normal-weight and obese women when food was used as reward. Importantly, no learning deficits were observed with money reward. Multiple regression analyses also established a robust negative association between body mass index and learning performance in the food domain in female participants. Interestingly, such impairment was not observed in obese men. These findings suggest that obesity may be linked to impaired reward-based associative learning and that this impairment may be specific to the food domain.},

This meta-analysis examined experimental and correlational studies testing the links between media exposure to women's body dissatisfaction, internalization of the thin ideal, and eating behaviors and beliefs with a sample of 77 studies that yielded 141 effect sizes. The mean effect sizes were small to moderate (ds = -.28, -.39, and -.30, respectively). Effects for some outcome variables were moderated by publication year and study design. The findings support the notion that exposure to media images depicting the thin-ideal body is related to body image concerns for women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

                   Summary It has been recently argued, coherently with previous research, that the media may be responsible for the spread of eating disorders. This article reviews this literature, and evaluates what the real role of the media in the spread of eating disorders is. The article argues that considering the portrait of thin models in the media industry as responsible for eating disorders is a misanalysis of the problem and evaluates some of the more profound reasons that may lead to the adoption of the disordered eating symptomatology.},
